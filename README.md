The official repository of [Protezione-civile](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19)  doesn't list the actual number of new positive cases, so I decided to make a small script that downloads the data to extract the daily number of new positive cases and plots it.

#### Disclamer:
I don't have anything against the data of the official repository and how they're represented, I'm actually proud of this decision to publish the data on github. I just couldn't find in their data what I was looking for.

#### Requirements:
- git
- R
